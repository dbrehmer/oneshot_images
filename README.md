# oneshot_images

This is an adaptation of the [paper by Koch et al.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf) applying Siamese Neural Networks to one-shot image verification evaluated on the [Olivetti Faces database](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/olivetti_faces.html). The VGG-Face CNN was used for both legs of the Siamese Network. Only the last layer of VGG-Face and the discriminator of the Siamese Network were trained to the Olivetti data.
